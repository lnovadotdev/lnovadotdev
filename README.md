# Hi, I'm Sam üëã

## About me

### Me as a person
I'm agender, aroace, and I don't use pronouns (they/them is fine if you can't deal with the extra grammar rules) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

### Where I am now
I'm a student at University of Staffordshire, currently studying Computer Games Programming and planning to complete a placement year in the future üìî

### My favourite tools
I focus on writing C++ and prefer to use Xcode. I also use JetBrains Rider when the project has to be formatted in the same way as Visual Studio. I currently use macOS Sequoia as my work OS. üßë‚Äçüíª

### My hobbies and interests
I enjoy coding, metal music (especially thrash metal), and I'm starting out on a digital art hobby. I like all animals, especially snakes üêç

### My public links
Besides GitHub, I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samson-hart-b69828226) page where I follow various game development studios and my [personal portfolio website](https://samhart.co.uk). Check it out! üéÆ

## My work
